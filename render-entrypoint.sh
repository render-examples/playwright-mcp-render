# Render entrypoint for Playwright MCP.

# Starts the full server: every capability enabled, no origin limits.
#
# Playwright MCP ships no authentication in HTTP mode, so anyone who can reach
# the URL can run code in this container. Restricting access is the operator's
# job — see the README "Security" section.
#
# The port comes from $PORT (Render sets it) and, by default, the server's host
# check is scoped to this service's own hostname via $RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME
# (Render sets it automatically), falling back to "*" for local runs. Set
# PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS to override — e.g. to add a custom domain
# (comma-separated) or to pass "*" to disable the host check.

# Upstream's own startup banner prints "http://localhost:$PORT/mcp", which is

# from the logs gets the right endpoint.
